# NouveauPG-OSX

NouveauPG was inspired by the difficulty described by journalists communicating with Edward Snowden a few years ago
regarding the difficulty in using PGP, a protocol that has been in use for 30 years (since like 1993). I wanted something
that was at its core a macOS app rather than a command line tool with a fancy GUI. (everything else, looking in your 
direction GPGTools.org....)

It is now my opinion that this is better off as an open source project although I'm not really looking to change much.
Personally my least favorite part is the certificate background which is maybe kind of hokey. The certificate seems to 
be the best metaphore.

Some of the code is probably kind of a mess but so is RFC 4880. (The Official IEEE OpenPGP spec)

Log an issue if you have any problems compiling, it should be an easy compile on macOS Sierra.
